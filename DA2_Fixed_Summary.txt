RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Feature engineering could be enhanced
- Consider ensemble methods
- Collect more diverse training data
- Address class imbalance issues

LIMITATIONS:
- Complex multi-class problem (15 classes)
- Limited feature set
- Potential class imbalance
- Temporal features are synthetic

CONCLUSION:
Realistic performance achieved with proper methodology.
Further improvement requires additional data and features.
